# 📊 Environmental Sensor Data Analysis

This project analyzes **temperature data** from environmental sensors and uses **Linear Regression** to predict temperature trends.

## 📝 Code Overview  

1️⃣ **Load & Prepare Data**  
   - Drops unnecessary columns and selects temperature (`temp`) as the target.  

2️⃣ **Split Data**  
   - Splits data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  

3️⃣ **Train Linear Regression Model**  
   - Fits a model to learn the relationship between sensor data and temperature.  

4️⃣ **Make Predictions**  
   - Uses the trained model to predict temperature values.  

5️⃣ **Evaluate Model Performance**  
   - Calculates **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score** to measure accuracy.  

6️⃣ **Visualize Results**  
   - Creates a **scatter plot** comparing actual vs. predicted temperatures.  

## 📈 Statistical Analysis  
- **Variance & Standard Deviation** show how much temperature readings fluctuate.  
- **Linear Regression** predicts temperature based on sensor inputs.  

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  
✔ The model explains **~78% of temperature variations**.  
✔ The scatter plot shows a **strong correlation** between actual and predicted values.  
✔ Variance & standard deviation help understand data spread.
